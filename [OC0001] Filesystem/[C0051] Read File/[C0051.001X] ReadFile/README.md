# Attention!
Ever since you need a `handler` to an opened file **in order to read it**, we provide here several examples of *opening a file* and reading it with `ReadFile()`.

Such examples include:
- CreateFile + ReadFile
- OpenFile + ReadFile

## TODO
- CreateFile2 + ReadFile
- CreateFileTransacted + ReadFile
- LZOpenFile + ReadFile
- OpenFileById + ReadFile
