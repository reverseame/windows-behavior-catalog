# Windows behavior repository
In this repository you will find a corpus of common Windows behaviors and their corresponding implementation. The source code is written in C++ and has been tested with `cl` (`Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.34.31935 for x86`).

# Contents
The contents present in this repository have been developed in part by the authors of the repo and other have been copied or adapted from other sources. Whenever the latter, the corresponding authors are credited.

## Categories
The code is divided into several categories:

- Filesystem
- Registry
- Process
- Network
- DLL 
- Scheduler

Within each category you will find the all the associated behaviors and their corresponding source code files as well as the executables and the reports generated from CAPEv2. For each behavior, the source code file has (or pretends to) a self-explanatory name. Within each category folder you will find the following structure: 

- **src**: Folder containing the source code files.
- **exe**: Folder containing the executable files.
- **reports**: Folder containing the report files, as generated by CAPEv2 (JSON formatted).

## Compilation

Files have been compiled with `cl`. The same compiler Visual Studio uses, bur from the command line: [Use the Microsoft C++ toolset from the command line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170).
